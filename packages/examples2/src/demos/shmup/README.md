# Shmup - Cherry Bomb

A port of the fantastic series by [Lazy Devs Academy](https://www.youtube.com/@LazyDevs). The Pico-8 playlist is found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLea8cjCua_P3Sfq4XJqNVbd1vsWnh7LZd).

## Differences

> Any differences between the original and this port I made. I might revert them to stay closer to the original.

I didn't bother with the `smol_spark` (small single pixel spark) spawned when the projectile hits the enemy, but doesn't destroy it. I found it got lost in the noise of the starfield.
